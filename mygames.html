                        <p>This game was created over a one month period, and utilized assets from the Unity Asset Store, both payed and free, to add high levels of detail. I was able to 
                            create a game that I was passionate about, and explore many different features and overcome problems. The Muted was a great learning experience and has allowed
                            me to take skills with me for the future.

                        <p>This was my first game made using Unity, at first it was a bit confusing but I easily learned the layout and controls. Not long after I was fiddling with 
                            different settings and was able to create a short but fun top-down shooter.</p>

                        <p>This game was a team project developed by a fellow classmate, James C, and myself. We made a dungeon crawler game 
                            and split up each part of the development process evenly between us to create this game.</p>
